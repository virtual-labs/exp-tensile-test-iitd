Steel is the most used structural material for the construction of civil engineering structures. Stress strain diagram represent the relation between stress and strain for a given material and is an important characteristic of the material. The stress-strain curve for steel is generally obtained from tensile test on standard specimens. An idealized stress strain curve for steel is shown below. An axially loaded tension member exhibits an elastic range (O–A) ending at yielding (B), followed by yield plateau (B-E). In the yield plateau, the load almost remains constant as the elongation increases to more than ten times the yield strain. On further loading, the material exhibits a smaller increase in tension due to reorientation of the crystal structure of the metal with elongation (E–F). This region is referred to as the strain hardening range. After reaching the ultimate load (F), the loading decreases as the elongation increases (F–G), until the specimen eventually fractures at (G).High strength steels, due to their specific microstructure, do not show a sharp yield point but rather theyyield continuously. For such steels, the yield stress is always taken as the stress at which a line at 0.2 per cent strain, parallel to the elastic portion, intercepts the stress strain curve.
